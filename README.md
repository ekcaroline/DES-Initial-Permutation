# Initial Permutation Simulation

## Overview

This Python script simulates the initial permutation (IP) step of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cryptographic algorithm. The program allows users to generate a random 64-bit plaintext or input their own. The generated or user-input plaintext undergoes the initial permutation, shuffling the bits based on a predefined permutation table. The results of the initial permutation are then displayed. Users have the option to perform the initial permutation or exit the program.

## Features

- **Generate a Random 64-Bit Plaintext:**
  - Creates a random 64-bit binary plaintext for initial permutation.

- **Input a 64-Bit Plaintext:**
  - Allows users to input their own 64-bit binary plaintext.

- **Initial Permutation:**
  - Implements the initial permutation step using a predefined permutation table.
